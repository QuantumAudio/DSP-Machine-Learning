# DSP - Machine Learning
Here we have the algorithms at the heart of most machine-learning applications, a couple of methods of trend extraction, sparse regularization and modeling, sparse deconvolution, sparse recovery, a couple of linear prediction methods, and adaptive filtering using gradient descent.
